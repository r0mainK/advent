# Advent of Code

## Description

This repository contains polished Python scripts which solve the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). As 2019 is the first year I participate, it's the only year for now.

## Usage

All scripts will be runnable with the following syntax:

```
python3 script.py <input_file>
```

In some cases, the logic is changed when running on the actual input rather then on test data. For the associated scripts, it's possible to add the string `test` as a second optional argument, to indicate this behavior is wanted. 

___NOTE:___ _Remove newlines at the end of the input files, it may break some scripts._
